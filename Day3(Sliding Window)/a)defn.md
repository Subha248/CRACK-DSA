# 🧠 SLIDING WINDOW (WITH COMPLEXITY)

👉 **Sliding Window is a technique used to process contiguous subarrays or substrings by maintaining a window using two pointers (left and right), and updating the result efficiently by adding the new element and removing the old one as the window moves.**

---

# ⚡ TIME COMPLEXITY

👉 **O(n)**

### Why?

* Each element is:

  * added **once** (when right moves)
  * removed **once** (when left moves)

👉 No nested loops → just one pass

---

# 📦 SPACE COMPLEXITY

👉 **O(1) or O(k) or O(n)** (depends on problem)

### Why?

* If no extra structure → **O(1)**
* If using set/map for window → **O(k)** or **O(n)**

# 🔥 ULTRA SHORT (INTERVIEW MIC DROP)

👉 **“Sliding window uses two pointers to maintain a contiguous window, updating results in O(n) time by adding and removing elements instead of recomputing.”**
